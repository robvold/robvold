I'm Robin, a soon to be software engineer, currently studying at NTNU Trondheim, Norway.  
My interests revolve mainly around computing, especially parallelization. I also have a keen interest in how different programming languages work, and therfore I have a desire to learn a functional language in the future, like Roc or Haskell. 

Another defining aspect of me is my utter hatred of Java. I define myself as an anti-java developer, that implying I want nothing but the complete removal of it from all corners of the world. I'm willing to go to extreme lengths to obtain this goal, even including programming i C#. If you're programming in java, you're my enemy.
